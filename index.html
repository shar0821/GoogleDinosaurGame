                The Dinosaur Game (also known as the Chrome Dino) is a browser game developed by Google and built into the Google Chrome web browser. 
                <br>
                The player guides a pixelated Tyrannosaurus rex across a side-scrolling landscape, avoiding obstacles to achieve a higher score. 
                <br>
                The game was created by members of the Chrome UX team in 2014, and is intended to be accessed by hitting the space bar when Google Chrome is offline.
